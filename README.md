sql-helper
===========

This project was an excuse for me to use some Purescript. After building the project, opening up the file `index.html` will provide a page with text boxes to help automatically build aliased select statements for MS-SQL.

You will need bower and gulp installed.

    npm install -g gulp
    npm install -g bower

Then install the bower and npm packages

    npm install
    bower update

and build the project

    grunt
